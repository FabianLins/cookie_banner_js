# Responsive Vanilla JavaScript Cookie Banner Notification by Fabian Lins
This is the Vanilla JavaScript version of my Cookie Banner Notification. There is also a jQuery JavaScript version of this available:
https://github.com/FabianLins/cookie_banner_jquery

To use this Cookie Banner, you have to do a few things:

# How does it work?
- I have used flex boxes for this banner.
- It checks if a cookie is set onload.
- If you hit ok, a cookie is set.
- If you click on reject, you get redirected (default is Google).

# Instruction
1. Link the "cookie_notification_style.css" file.
2. Link the "cookie_notification_code.js" file.
3. Copy the lines between the two comments in the HTML file and paste them into your HTML file.
4. Adjust HTML the lines to your desires (but keep in mind that you have to keep the structure as it is).
5. Adjust the SCSS variables.
6. Compile the SCSS sheet.
  NOTE: If you are new to it, feel free to check out this compiler: https://scout-app.io/
8. Adjust the JS variables in the "cookie_notification_code.js" file.
